### User Story
As a security-conscious raccoon in human disguise, I want to reject weird symbols in input so the app doesn’t break or summon an eldritch database spirit.

### Acceptance Criteria
Only allows alphanumeric input (e.g., “abc123”).

Rejects nonsense like “DROP TABLE users;” or “<blink>hi</blink>.”

Has at least 3 tests proving it works—and doesn't panic under pressure.
