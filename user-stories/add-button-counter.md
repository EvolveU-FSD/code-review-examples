### User Story
As someone who deeply enjoys clicking buttons for no real reason, I want a counter that ticks up with each click so I can feel productive while avoiding my actual work.

### Acceptance Criteria
Button starts at 0 and increments by 1 with each click.

The count should never say “a lot” or “idk lol.”

Does not throw existential questions at the user like “Why are you still clicking?”
