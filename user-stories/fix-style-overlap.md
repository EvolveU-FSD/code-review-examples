### User Story
As someone with a strong emotional attachment to pixels, I want consistent spacing so that I can sleep at night knowing the margins are aligned.

### Acceptance Criteria
Global styles have been adjusted to prevent margin collapse-related disasters.

Layout should not resemble modern art unless that’s a feature.

No component should sit awkwardly close like it’s trying to whisper a secret.
