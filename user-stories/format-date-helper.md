### User Story
As a sentient time traveler who’s very picky, I want dates to be formatted nicely so I can stop yelling “What century is this?” every time I check a timestamp.

### Acceptance Criteria
Function formatDate() exists and returns civilized strings like “May 15, 2025.”

Accepts Date objects, not vibes.

At least two test cases pass—ideally from this timeline.
