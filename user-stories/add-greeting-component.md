### User Story
As a socially anxious introvert opening this app, I want to be greeted politely so I don’t feel ghosted by a blank screen.

### Acceptance Criteria
A Greeting component exists and says “Hello, Guest!”

Appears on the homepage without making loud noises or asking for small talk.

Does not call the user “bro” unless explicitly configured to do so.
